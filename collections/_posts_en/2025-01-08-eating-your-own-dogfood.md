In the world of business, technology, and product development, there's a quirky yet powerful phrase that often gets thrown around: "Eating your own dog food." While the imagery might not be appetizing, the concept behind it is crucial for building trust, ensuring quality, and fostering innovation.

## What does "eating your own dog food" mean?

The phrase originates from the idea that if a company creates a product, it should be willing to use that product itself. In other words, if you're selling dog food, you should be confident enough in its quality to feed it to your own dog. 

The earliest known reference traces back to the 1970s, when actor Lorne Greene appeared in a television advertisement for Alpo dog food, proudly stating that he fed Alpo to his own dogs. This act of personal endorsement resonated with audiences, suggesting that if a product was good enough for the spokesperson's pets, it was good enough for consumers. Another possible origin comes from Kal Kan Pet Food, whose president reportedly ate a can of his company's dog food during annual shareholder meetings to demonstrate confidence in the product.

In a business context, it means using your own products or services internally before offering them to customers. This practice is also known as "dogfooding."

For example, if a software company develops a new project management tool, the team should use that tool to manage their own projects. If a restaurant creates a new menu item, the chefs and staff should taste it before serving it to customers. The idea is simple: if you're not willing to use your own product, why should anyone else?

Interestingly, the term gained widespread popularity in the 1980s when Microsoft adopted the practice, requiring employees to use its software internally. This not only helped the company identify bugs but also demonstrated confidence in its products to the outside world.

## Why eating your owndog food matters

### 1. Builds trust with customers
When customers see that you're using your own product, it sends a powerful message: you believe in what you're selling. It demonstrates confidence and authenticity, which are key to building trust. If you're not willing to use your own product, it raises red flags about its quality or effectiveness. For instance, when Tesla employees drive Teslas, it reinforces the brand's credibility and commitment to its mission of sustainable transportation.

### 2. Identifies flaws and improves quality
Using your own product allows you to experience it from the customer's perspective. You'll quickly discover any pain points, bugs, or areas for improvement. This firsthand feedback is invaluable for refining your product and ensuring it meets the needs of your users. For example, Google's early adoption of dogfooding for Gmail allowed the company to catch usability issues that might have been missed in traditional testing environments.

### 3. Encourages innovation
When you're actively using your own product, you're more likely to think creatively about how to make it better. You'll notice opportunities for new features or enhancements that you might not have considered otherwise. This can lead to innovative solutions that set your product apart from the competition. Facebook's development of its "Reactions" feature is a great example—employees tested the emoticons extensively, leading to a more intuitive and user-friendly design.

### 4. Aligns your team with your mission
Dogfooding fosters a sense of ownership and pride within your team. When employees use the product they've helped create, they become more invested in its success. It also ensures that everyone is aligned with the company's mission and values. At companies like Slack, employees using the platform for internal communication helps them understand the user experience deeply, driving a culture of empathy and collaboration.


### 5. Demonstrates commitment
Eating your own dog food shows that you're committed to delivering value, not just making a sale. It proves that you're in it for the long haul and that you care about the experience your customers have with your product. For example, when Starbucks baristas taste new drinks before they're added to the menu, it shows a dedication to quality that resonates with customers.

## How to start eating your own dog food

If you're not already practicing dogfooding, here's how to get started:

1. **Make it a priority**: Encourage your team to use your product or service regularly. Make it part of your company culture. For example, if you're developing a fitness app, have your team use it to track their workouts and health goals.

2. **Gather feedback**: Create a system for collecting feedback from employees who use the product. What do they like? What frustrates them? Use this input to make improvements. Consider using anonymous surveys or regular feedback sessions to ensure honesty.

3. **Lead by example**: As a leader, show your team that you're committed to dogfooding by using the product yourself. If you're the CEO of a SaaS company, use your own software to manage your tasks and projects.

4. **Iterate and improve**: Use the insights you gain to refine your product and make it even better. For instance, if employees report that a feature is confusing, prioritize redesigning it before the next release.

## The bottom line

Eating your own dog food isn't just a catchy phrase—it's a mindset. It's about taking pride in your work, being accountable to your customers, and continuously striving for excellence. By using your own product, you'll not only improve its quality but also build trust, foster innovation, and create a stronger connection with your audience. It's a practice that transcends industries, from tech giants like Microsoft to coffee shops like Starbucks, proving its universal value.

So, the next time you're tempted to skip this step, ask yourself: If I won't use it, why should anyone else?

In the end, eating your own dog food is a recipe for success—one that ensures your product is as good as you claim it to be. Bon appétit!
