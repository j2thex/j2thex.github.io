description: "Led product analytics, experimentation, and UX optimization for the world's leading dApp analytics platform"
full_description: |
  Our team worked with DappRadar to lead strategic initiatives focused on product analytics, user retention, blockchain metrics expansion, and A/B testing. Key achievements include expanding metrics coverage to 70+ blockchains, improving performance scores from under 20 to over 50, and building a developer monetization system with Stripe integration. We also co-shaped the AI agent ecosystem strategy, pivoting from RWA to gaming-focused initiatives based on data insights, and introduced two new trend pages: RWA and Gambling.

challenge: |
  DappRadar faced critical challenges including 81% slow pages, low mobile performance scores (under 20), low PRO conversion (0.19%), and the need to expand blockchain metrics coverage. The platform needed better user engagement, improved data accuracy, and a viable monetization strategy for developers.
solution: |
  - Led performance optimization initiatives: Cloudflare image optimization, asset compression, mobile tooltip redesign
  - Expanded metrics coverage: Delivered new Unique Active Wallet (UAW) metrics for 70+ blockchains and smart contracts per chain metric
  - Built developer monetization system with Stripe integration for PRO subscriptions
  - Designed and executed multiple A/B tests (homepage layouts, tab naming, user surveys)
  - Co-developed AI agent swarm strategy focused on gaming dApps tracking
  - Improved UX through homepage improvements, sidebar reorganization, and global font unification
results: |
  - Improved mobile performance scores from under 20 to over 50
  - Expanded blockchain metrics coverage to 70+ blockchains, improving dApp ranking quality
  - Achieved 166K monthly active users with 47% direct traffic (strong brand loyalty)
  - Gamification features (Quests) performed exceptionally well with 48K views
  - Built developer subscription system ready for launch
  - Established experimentation framework with Looker dashboards for data-driven decisions

## Focus Areas

- Product analytics and experimentation
- User retention and engagement
- Blockchain metrics and integrations
- A/B testing and onboarding optimization
- AI agent ecosystem planning (Gaming-focused)
- Developer monetization and PRO subscription
- Performance optimization and UX

## Key Metrics (Aug–Sep 2025)

- **Monthly Active Users:** 166K (stable, modest growth)
- **Daily Active Users:** 6.3K (DAU/MAU ratio 3.8%, target 5%)
- **Avg Engagement Time:** 2m 06s (solid for analytics-heavy platform)
- **Direct Traffic:** 47% (very strong brand loyalty)
- **Conversion (PRO):** 0.19% (306 users)
- **Chains Tracked:** 89 (broad coverage)

## Strategic Initiatives

### 1. User Experience & Performance Optimization
- **Target:** Reduce 81% slow pages; improve mobile performance scores (under 20 → >50)
- **Tasks:** Cloudflare image optimization, asset compression, mobile tooltip redesign
- **Result:** Successfully improved mobile performance scores to over 50

### 2. Metrics Expansion & Data Accuracy
- Delivered new Unique Active Wallet (UAW) metrics for 70+ blockchains
- Smart contracts per chain metric implementation
- Introduced two new trend pages: RWA and Gambling
- **Impact:** Improved dApp ranking quality and user trust

### 3. Developer Monetization Initiative
- Built subscription model with Stripe integration
- PRO flow redesign and staking logic improvements

### 4. AI Agent Swarm (Gaming-Focused)
- Pivoted AI strategy from RWA to Gaming due to data and audience alignment
- Objective: Build an AI swarm tracking gaming dApps, stats, and social signals (X, Discord)

## A/B Tests & Experiments

- **Analytics → Stats Tab Rename:** Testing user comprehension (users still prefer "Analytics")
- **Boosting → Vote for dApps Rename:** Simpler term to improve engagement
- **Homepage Expand/Collapse:** Users prefer expanded view (completed)
- **User Survey with XP Incentives:** Goal of 1,000+ responses
- **Mobile Tooltip Optimization:** Planned for Q4 2025

## Key Learnings

- Real user behavior often contradicts design intuition → always test
- Language clarity ("boost" vs "vote") directly affects engagement
- Cross-functional collaboration (SEO, design, backend) crucial for fast iteration
- Performance optimization is a prerequisite for new feature success

## Tools & Tech Stack

- **Data & Analytics:** BigQuery, Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode, Honeypot, Codex
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React
- **A/B Testing:** Internal framework
- **Design:** Figma, Crazy Egg
- **Communication:** Slack, Cockpit CMS, Google Docs
- **Blockchain & Web3:** RADAR token staking, DIA API, LiFi integration research
