  ## Goal
  During my time at CEX.IO, I led the development and launch of high-availability services like the CEX.IO exchange and GHash.io mining pool, which reached 51% of global Bitcoin mining power. I managed the product vision and roadmap, ensuring compliance with global AML & KYC regulations, and facilitated company growth from 4 to 150 employees. Additionally, I represented the company at major blockchain conferences, built strategic partnerships, and handled PR during critical moments, such as mitigating the 51% Bitcoin panic.
